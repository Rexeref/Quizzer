I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking black clouds in isolation\\\\true
A sunset calls me here\\\\false
I swear to love it's true\\\\false

I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames, I have been blessed\\\\true
How dare you not to see?\\\\false
How dare you not believe?\\\\false
In the glow of Helios\\\\false

My family crest is a demon of death
Forsakened, I am awakened\\\\true
Waterless like the ocean\\\\false
Come emerge and wallow\\\\false

A phoenix's ash in dark divine
Descending misery/Destiny chasing time\\\\true
A place where daylight aches\\\\false
A world we must set free\\\\false
